## Starting Your First Conversation

Chatting with AI in Nexal is as simple as texting a friend, but much more powerful!

### How to Start a Chat

**On Mobile:**
1. Open the Chat tab
2. Tap the text input box at the bottom
3. Type your question or message
4. Tap the Send button
5. Watch the AI respond in real-time as it types

### Understanding AI Responses

- AI responses appear word-by-word (streaming) for a natural conversation feel
- Responses are formatted with proper paragraphs, code blocks, and structure
- You can copy, share, or regenerate any response
- Long-press on a message to see options

### Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: Instead of "tell me about dogs," try "what are the best dog breeds for families with children?"
- **Provide context**: "I'm planning a trip to Japan. What should I pack?"
- **Ask follow-up questions**: The AI remembers your conversation
- **Use examples**: "Write a professional email like this: [example]"

## Choosing the Right AI Model

### What Are AI Models?

Think of AI models as different experts with different specialties. Some are great at creative writing, others excel at coding, and some are perfect for analysis. Nexal AI gives you access to over 100 different AI models!

### How to Change Models

**On Mobile:**
1. In the Chat tab, tap the model name at the bottom of the page

- **Pro**: Premium models with better quality and reasoning
- **Basic**: Standard models for general use
- **Legacy**: Older versions, still available if needed

## Using Personas

### What Are Personas?

Personas are pre-configured AI assistants designed for specific tasks. Instead of explaining what you want each time, personas give the AI a role and set of instructions automatically.

### How to Use a Persona

**On Mobile:**
1. In the Chat input, type `@` followed by the name of the persona you want to use
2. Browse available personas from the dropdown
3. Select a persona
4. Start chatting - the AI will automatically adopt that role!

### Creating Custom Personas

Want your own specialized assistant? Create a custom persona:

**On Mobile:**
1. Go to the Personas screen
2. Tap "Create New Persona"
3. Fill in name, description, and instructions
4. Upload an avatar (optional)
5. Save and use in any conversation

## Managing Conversations

### Organizing with Folders

Keep your conversations organized:

**On Mobile:**
1. Open the folder from the main screen
2. Upload files and documents to organize with your conversations
3. Access folder contents directly in chat for reference

### Archiving Conversations

1. The AI can automatically search the web when needed
2. Results are integrated into the response with citations
3. Great for current events, real-time data, and recent information

### Reasoning Controls

Control how much the AI thinks before answering. Low for quick facts, Medium for most things, High when you need deep analysis. It'll show you its reasoning process, which is great for understanding how it solved something or catching errors in logic.

### Rapid Mode

Type `!rapid` before your message to get faster responses. The AI skips the deep thinking and gives you the first good answer.

Good for simple questions. Not great for complex problems where you want a thorough answer.
