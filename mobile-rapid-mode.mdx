## What is Rapid Mode?

Rapid Mode makes the AI respond faster. It's for when you need a quick answer and don't need the AI to think deeply about it.

Think of it like this: normal mode is the AI taking its time to give you a thorough answer. Rapid mode is the AI giving you the first good answer it comes up with.

## When to Use It

**Good for Rapid Mode:**
- Quick questions with straightforward answers
- Simple tasks that don't need much thought
- When you're in a hurry
- Casual conversation

**Stick with normal mode for:**
- Complex problems that need analysis
- Detailed explanations
- Creative writing that needs to be polished
- Anything where quality matters more than speed

## How to Use Rapid Mode

### On Web

Type `!rapid` followed by a space before your message:

```
!rapid What's the capital of France?
```

Or click the Rapid Mode toggle in the chat interface if it's available.

### On Mobile

Just type `!rapid` + space before your question, same as web.

## What's the Difference?

With Rapid Mode on, you'll notice:
- Faster response times
- Shorter, more direct answers
- Less detailed explanations

It's still the same AI, just optimized for speed instead of depth.
