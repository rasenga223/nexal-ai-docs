## What are Memories?

Memories allow the AI to remember important information about you across all conversations. Think of it as giving the AI a persistent memory of your preferences, facts, and context that it can recall whenever needed.

## How Memories Work

When you save a memory, the AI stores that information and automatically recalls it when relevant in future conversations. This creates a more personalized experience where the AI knows your preferences without you having to repeat them.

## Saving Memories

### From Chat

**Automatic**: The AI can save memories when you share important information:
- "Remember that I prefer Python over JavaScript"
- "I'm allergic to peanuts"
- "My favorite color is blue"

**Manual**: You can explicitly ask the AI to remember something:
- "Remember this: I work in healthcare"
- "Save this to memory: My birthday is June 15"

### What Not to Save

**Sensitive Information**:

- Credit card numbers

- Private addresses

**Temporary Information**:

**Too Specific**:

## How AI Uses Memories

The AI automatically recalls relevant memories when:
- Answering questions
- Making recommendations
- Providing personalized advice
- Understanding context

**Example**:
If you've saved "I prefer Python over JavaScript" as a memory, when you ask for code examples, the AI will automatically provide Python code without you having to specify.

## Privacy

**Your Control**: You have full control over what's saved and can delete memories anytime

**Secure Storage**: Memories are encrypted and stored securely

**Not Shared**: Your memories are private and never shared with others

## Tips for Effective Memories

**Be Specific**: "I prefer dark mode in all apps" is better than "I like dark mode"

**Keep Updated**: Delete or update memories when they're no longer accurate

**Use Categories**: Group related memories (work preferences, personal info, etc.)

**Review Regularly**: Check your memories occasionally and clean up outdated ones

<Tip>
Memories work best for facts and preferences that stay consistent over time. For temporary context, just mention it in your conversation.
