## Creating Images with AI

### Getting Started with Image Generation

**What is AI Image Generation?**

Describe what you want to see, and AI creates it! No drawing skills needed - just describe your vision in words, and watch it come to life.

**How to Generate Your First Image**:

1. Open the Generate tab
2. Tap the text input box
3. Describe what you want (e.g., "a futuristic city at sunset")
4. Choose image size (square, wide, or tall)
5. Select a style preset (optional)
6. Tap Generate
7. Wait 10-30 seconds for your image

**Understanding Image Sizes**:

- **Square** (1:1): Perfect for social media posts, profile pictures
- **Wide** (16:9): Great for wallpapers, banners, presentations
- **Tall** (9:16): Ideal for mobile wallpapers, stories

**Style Presets**:

Choose a style to match your vision:

- **Realistic**: Photorealistic images
- **Artistic**: Paintings and artistic styles
- **Anime**: Anime and manga style
- **3D Render**: 3D rendered graphics
- **Sketch**: Hand-drawn sketch style

### Image Generation Tips

**Writing Effective Prompts**:

The better you describe what you want, the better the result!

**Good Prompt Examples**:
- "A serene mountain landscape at sunrise, with snow-capped peaks, a calm lake in the foreground reflecting the mountains, soft pink and orange sky, photorealistic style"
- "A cute cartoon robot with big eyes, holding a flower, pastel colors, simple background, friendly expression"

**Prompt Structure**:
1. **Subject**: What is the main focus? (e.g., "a cat")
2. **Details**: Add specifics (e.g., "orange tabby cat, sitting")
3. **Setting**: Where is it? (e.g., "on a windowsill")
4. **Style**: How should it look? (e.g., "photorealistic, soft lighting")
5. **Mood**: What feeling? (e.g., "peaceful, warm")

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Too vague: "a picture" → Better: "a picture of a sunset over mountains"
- Too many conflicting ideas: Keep it focused
- Forgetting style: Always specify realistic, artistic, cartoon, etc.

**Using Style Presets**:

Style presets help you get consistent results:

1. Tap "Style" before generating
2. Select a preset
3. Your prompt automatically includes style instructions
4. Generate your image

**Batch Generation**:

Need multiple variations?

## Creating Videos with AI

### Video Generation Basics

**What is AI Video Generation?**

Describe a scene or action, and AI creates a short video clip! Perfect for social media, presentations, or creative projects.

**How Text-to-Video Works**:

1. You describe what you want to see
2. AI interprets your description
3. Video is generated frame-by-frame
4. You get a short video clip (usually 5-10 seconds)

**Generating Your First Video**:

1. Open the Generate tab
2. Switch to "Video" mode
3. Describe your video (e.g., "a cat playing with a ball of yarn")
4. Set video parameters:
   - **Dimensions**: Width and height (e.g., 1280x720)
   - **Duration**: How long (5-10 seconds)
   - **Steps**: Quality level (more steps = better quality, longer wait)
   - **Guidance**: How closely to follow your prompt
5. Tap Generate
6. Wait 1-5 minutes (video generation takes longer than images)
7. Watch your video!

**Progress Tracking**:

While your video generates:
- See progress percentage
- Estimated time remaining
- You can minimize the app and return later
- Get a notification when it's ready

### Video Tips & Best Practices

**Writing Video Prompts**:

Videos work best with action descriptions:

**Good Video Prompts**:
- "A wave crashing on a beach at sunset, slow motion"
- "A person walking through a forest, camera following behind"
- "Flowers blooming in time-lapse, vibrant colors"

**Video Prompt Tips**:
- Include movement: Videos need action!
- Specify camera movement: "panning left," "zooming in," "static camera"
- Describe timing: "slow motion," "time-lapse," "normal speed"
- Keep it simple: One main action works best

**Choosing Dimensions**:

- **1280x720 (HD)**: Standard quality, faster generation
- **1920x1080 (Full HD)**: Higher quality, longer wait
- **Square (1080x1080)**: Perfect for Instagram, TikTok

**Understanding Generation Time**:

Video generation takes time because:
- Each frame must be generated
- Frames are combined into smooth video
- Higher quality = more processing time

**Typical Wait Times**:
- 5-second video, HD: 2-3 minutes
- 10-second video, Full HD: 4-5 minutes
- Higher quality settings: Up to 10 minutes

**Video Limits**:

- **Free Plan**: No video generation
- **Plus Plan**: 10 videos per day
- **Max Plan**: Unlimited videos

**Managing Your Videos**:

1. Go to Media tab
2. Tap "Videos"
3. View all your generated videos
4. Tap to play full-screen
5. Share or download like images

- **Company Knowledge Base**: Train an AI on your company documents
- **Personal Assistant**: Create an AI that knows your preferences and information
- **Specialized Domain**: Train an AI on specific topics (medical, legal, technical)
- **Research Assistant**: Upload research papers and ask questions

**Real-World Examples**:
- A lawyer creates a model trained on case law
- A student creates a model from their textbook
- A business creates a model from their documentation
- A researcher creates a model from their papers

### Creating Your Own AI

**Step-by-Step Guide**:

1. **Prepare Your Documents**:
   - Gather PDFs, Word docs, or text files
   - Organize them by topic
   - Make sure they're relevant to your model's purpose

   - Go to Settings → Custom Models
   - Tap "Create New Model"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "My Research Assistant")
   - Write a description

3. **Choose a Base Model**:
   - Select from available AI models
   - GPT-4 recommended for best results
   - This determines the AI's capabilities

4. **Upload Knowledge Base**:
   - Upload your documents
   - Wait for processing (may take a few minutes)
   - Documents are converted to searchable knowledge

5. **Test Your Model**:
   - Start a chat with your custom model
   - Ask questions related to your documents
   - Verify it answers correctly

6. **Use Your Model**:
   - Access it from the Chat tab
   - Select it like any other model
   - Ask questions using your knowledge base!

**Training Tips**:

- Remove irrelevant information
- Update regularly with new documents

**Model Limits**:
- **Free Plan**: No custom models
- **Plus Plan**: Up to 200 custom models
- **Max Plan**: Unlimited custom models

### Sharing Models

**Public vs Private Models**:

**Private Models** (Default):
