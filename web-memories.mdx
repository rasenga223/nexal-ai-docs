## What are Memories?

Memories let the AI remember things about you across all your conversations. Instead of telling it every time that you prefer Python, or that you're allergic to peanuts, it just knows.

## How It Works

When you're chatting, the AI picks up on important stuff you mention and saves it as a memory. Next time you talk, it already knows those details about you.

For example, if you tell it "I prefer dark mode in all my apps," it'll remember that. Later when you ask about app design, it'll factor in your preference without you having to mention it again.

## Saving Memories

There are two ways memories get saved:

**The AI does it automatically** when you share something important:
- "I'm allergic to peanuts"
- "My favorite color is blue"
- "I work in healthcare"

**You can tell it explicitly** to remember something:
- "Remember that I prefer Python over JavaScript"
- "Save this to memory: My birthday is June 15"

That's it. You don't manually add memories through a form or anything - it all happens through conversation.

## Viewing Your Memories

1. Go to Settings → Memories
2. Browse your saved memories
3. Click to expand and read each one

## Deleting Memories

Changed your mind about something? You can delete any memory.

1. Go to Settings → Memories
2. Click on a memory
3. Click "Delete"
4. Confirm

## What Makes a Good Memory?

**Things that work well:**
- Preferences that stay the same (programming languages, dietary restrictions)
- Your background (profession, education, location)
- Projects you're working on
- Tools and tech you use regularly

**Things to avoid:**
- Passwords, API keys, credit cards (seriously, don't)
- Today's weather or other temporary stuff
- Very detailed instructions (that's what Personas are for)

## How the AI Uses Memories

The AI checks your memories when answering questions, making suggestions, or just chatting. It uses them to give you more relevant, personalized responses.

If it has a memory that you prefer Python, it'll write code examples in Python. If it knows you're in New York, it won't suggest lunch spots in Tokyo.

## Your Privacy

Your memories are yours. They're stored securely, never shared with anyone else, and you can delete them whenever you want.

## A Few Tips

Keep your memories up to date - if something changes, tell the AI and it'll update accordingly. Also, don't stress about remembering to use the memory feature. The AI is pretty good at figuring out what's worth remembering.

<Note>
Memories are for things that don't change much. For one-off context, just say it in the conversation. You don't need to make it a memory.
