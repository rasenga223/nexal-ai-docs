## Getting Started with Image Generation


### What is AI Image Generation?

Describe what you want to see, and AI creates it! No drawing skills needed - just describe your vision in words, and watch it come to life.

### How to Generate Your First Image


Generate images directly within your conversations:

1. In any chat, type `/image` or ask the AI to create an image
2. Describe what you want
3. The AI generates the image in the conversation
4. View, save, or share directly from chat

## Image-to-Image Generation

Transform existing images or use them as a starting point for new creations. Upload an image and modify it with AI.

### How It Works

1. In any chat, type `/image` or ask the AI to create an image
2. Tap the image attachment icon to upload a reference image
3. Describe the changes you want to make
4. The AI modifies or reimagines your image
5. View, save, or share the result

### Image-to-Image Use Cases

**Style Transfer:**
- "Make this photo look like a watercolor painting"
- "Convert this image to anime style"
- "Transform this into a pencil sketch"

**Modifications:**
- "Change the background to a beach scene"
- "Add snow to this landscape"
- "Make this daytime photo look like nighttime"

**Variations:**
- "Create a similar scene but with different colors"
- "Generate a version of this in a futuristic style"
- "Reimagine this composition with different elements"

### Understanding Aspect Ratios

Choose the right aspect ratio for your use case:

- **Square (1:1)**: Perfect for social media posts, profile pictures
- **Wide (16:9)**: Great for wallpapers, banners, presentations
- **Tall (9:16)**: Ideal for mobile wallpapers, stories, vertical content
- **Standard (4:3)**: Classic photo ratio, versatile for many uses
- **Portrait (3:4)**: Good for portraits and vertical compositions

### Output Formats

**Available Formats:**
- **PNG**: High quality, supports transparency
- **JPEG**: Smaller file size, good for photos
- **WebP**: Modern format, excellent compression

## Image Generation Models

Multiple AI providers are available for image generation

Select your preferred model in the menu options before generating.

## Image Generation Tips

### Writing Effective Prompts

The better you describe what you want, the better the result!

**Good Prompt Examples:**
- "A serene mountain landscape at sunrise, with snow-capped peaks, a calm lake in the foreground reflecting the mountains, soft pink and orange sky, photorealistic style"
- "A cute cartoon robot with big eyes, holding a flower, pastel colors, simple background, friendly expression"

### Prompt Structure

1. **Subject**: What is the main focus? (e.g., "a cat")
2. **Details**: Add specifics (e.g., "orange tabby cat, sitting")
3. **Setting**: Where is it? (e.g., "on a windowsill")
4. **Style**: How should it look? (e.g., "photorealistic, soft lighting")
5. **Mood**: What feeling? (e.g., "peaceful, warm")

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too vague**: "a picture" → Better: "a picture of a sunset over mountains"
- **Too many conflicting ideas**: Keep it focused
- **Forgetting style**: Always specify realistic, artistic, cartoon, etc.

### Style Presets

Style presets help you get consistent results:

**Available Styles:**
- **Realistic**: Photorealistic images
- **Artistic**: Paintings and artistic styles
- **Anime**: Anime and manga style
- **3D Render**: 3D rendered graphics
- **Sketch**: Hand-drawn sketch style
- **Digital Art**: Modern digital artwork
