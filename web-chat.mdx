## Starting Your First Conversation

Chatting with AI in Nexal is as simple as texting a friend, but much more powerful!

### How to Start a Chat

1. Open the Chat section
2. Click in the message input at the bottom
3. Type your question or message
4. Press Enter or click Send
5. Watch the AI respond in real-time

### Understanding AI Responses

- AI responses appear word-by-word (streaming) for a natural conversation feel
- Responses are formatted with proper paragraphs, code blocks, and structure
- You can copy, share, or regenerate any response
- Right-click on a message to see options

### Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: Instead of "tell me about dogs," try "what are the best dog breeds for families with children?"
- **Provide context**: "I'm planning a trip to Japan. What should I pack?"
- **Ask follow-up questions**: The AI remembers your conversation
- **Use examples**: "Write a professional email like this: [example]"

## Choosing the Right AI Model

### What Are AI Models?

Think of AI models as different experts with different specialties. Some are great at creative writing, others excel at coding, and some are perfect for analysis. Nexal AI gives you access to over 100 different AI models!

### How to Change Models

1. Click the model selector in the chat header
2. Browse available models by category
3. Select the model you want to use
4. Your conversation continues with the new model

### Model Categories

- **Fast**: Quick responses, great for simple tasks
- **Pro**: Premium models with better quality and reasoning
- **Basic**: Standard models for general use
- **Legacy**: Older versions, still available if needed

## Using Personas

### What Are Personas?

Personas are pre-configured AI assistants designed for specific tasks. Instead of explaining what you want each time, personas give the AI a role and set of instructions automatically.

### How to Use a Persona

1. Click the persona selector in the chat header
2. Browse available personas
3. Select a persona
4. Start chatting - the AI will automatically adopt that role!

### Creating Custom Personas

Want your own specialized assistant? Create a custom persona:

1. Go to the Personas tab in the chat header
2. Click "Create New Persona"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "My Study Buddy")
4. Write instructions (e.g., "You are a helpful study assistant who explains concepts simply")
5. Choose an avatar (optional)
6. Save your persona
7. Make it public or keep it private

## Managing Conversations

### Organizing with Folders

Keep your conversations organized:

1. Hover over a conversation
2. Select "Move to Folder"
3. Create a new folder or select an existing one
4. Organize by topic, project, or date

### Archiving Conversations

Don't want to delete a conversation but need to clear space?

1. Hover over a conversation
2. Select "Archive"
3. Find archived conversations in the sidebar

### Deleting Conversations

## Advanced Chat Features

### Web Search Integration

Need up-to-date information? Enable web search:

1. Click the web search toggle in the chat input area
2. Your question will search the web before answering
3. The AI will cite sources in its response

### Reasoning Controls

Control how much the AI thinks before answering. Low for quick facts, Medium for most things, High when you need deep analysis. It'll show you its reasoning process, which is great for understanding how it solved something or catching errors in logic.

### Rapid Mode

Type `!rapid` before your message to get faster responses. The AI skips the deep thinking and gives you the first good answer.

Good for simple questions. Not great for complex problems where you want a thorough answer.

### Document Uploads

Upload files directly in chat:

1. Click the attachment icon or drag and drop files
2. Select files (images, PDFs, documents)
3. The AI can read and analyze your uploads
4. Ask questions about the content

**Supported File Types:**
- PDF documents
- Images (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Text files

### Tools

Tools extend the AI's capabilities beyond text generation.

- **Resume**: Generate professional resumes from your information
- **Image Generation**: Create images directly from chat using text descriptions
- **Document**: Write and edit documents in DOCX format with a built-in editor
- **Memory**: Save important information that the AI can recall in future conversations
- **Web Search**: Get real-time information from the internet

To use tools, type `/` in the chat input to see available options, or just ask the AI naturally.
