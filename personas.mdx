## What Are Personas?

Personas are pre-configured AI assistants designed for specific tasks and roles. Instead of explaining what you want each time, personas automatically give the AI a role and set of instructions, making your interactions more efficient and consistent.

### Why Use Personas?

- **Consistency**: Get responses in the same style and format every time
- **Efficiency**: No need to repeat instructions or context
- **Specialization**: Access expert-level assistance for specific domains
- **Customization**: Create your own personas tailored to your needs

## Using Personas

### How to Select a Persona

**On Mobile:**
1. In the Chat input, type `@` followed by the name of the persona you want to use
2. Browse available personas from the dropdown
3. Select a persona
4. Start chatting - the AI will automatically adopt that role!

**On Web:**
1. Click the persona selector in the chat header
2. Browse available personas
3. Select a persona
4. Start chatting - the AI will automatically adopt that role!

### Pre-Built Personas

Nexal AI includes many pre-built personas for different use cases:

- **Writing Assistant**: Helps with essays, articles, and creative writing

Each persona is optimized for its specific domain, providing expert-level assistance without you having to explain the context.

## Creating Custom Personas

Want your own specialized assistant? Create a custom persona to match your exact needs.

### On Web

1. Go to the Personas tab in the chat header
2. Click "Create New Persona"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "My Study Buddy" or "Project Manager")
4. Write detailed instructions defining the persona's role
5. Choose an avatar (optional)
6. Set privacy (public or private)
7. Save your persona
8. Use it in any conversation!

### On Mobile

1. Go to the Personas screen from the main menu
2. Tap "Create New Persona"

   - Custom instructions
   - Avatar/image (optional)
   - Category
4. Set privacy (public or private)
5. Save and start using your persona

### Writing Effective Persona Instructions

Good instructions make personas more effective:

**What to Include:**
- **Role Definition**: Who is this persona? (e.g., "You are a technical support specialist")
- **Expertise**: What knowledge does it have? (e.g., "specialized in software troubleshooting")
- **Tone & Style**: How should it communicate? (e.g., "friendly, patient, and clear")
- **Behavior**: How should it act? (e.g., "always ask clarifying questions before troubleshooting")
- **Format**: How should it structure responses? (e.g., "provide step-by-step solutions")

**Example Instructions:**
```
You are a helpful study assistant for computer science students.
You explain complex programming concepts in simple terms, use
code examples, and break down difficult topics into manageable
chunks. Always encourage learning and provide practice exercises
when relevant.
```

### Privacy Settings

**Private:**
- Only you can access and use the persona
- Perfect for personal assistants or internal team use

**Public:**
- Share your persona with others
- Others can use it but cannot modify it
- Great for sharing helpful assistants with your team or community

## Managing Personas

### Editing Personas

**On Web:**
1. Go to the Personas tab
2. Find the persona you want to edit
3. Click "Edit"
4. Modify the name, instructions, or avatar
5. Save your changes

**On Mobile:**
1. Go to the Personas screen
2. Tap on the persona you want to edit
3. Make your changes
4. Save

### Organizing Personas

Keep your personas organized:

- **Favorite frequently used personas** for quick access
- **Group by category** (work, personal, creative, etc.)
- **Delete unused personas** to keep your list clean


## Tips for Better Personas

### Be Specific
The more detailed your instructions, the better the persona performs. Include specific examples of how you want the AI to respond.

### Test and Refine
Try your persona with different types of questions. If it doesn't respond the way you want, adjust the instructions.

### Use Categories
Organize personas into categories like Work, Personal, Creative, and Learning to find them quickly.

### Share Useful Personas
If you create a persona that others might find helpful, consider making it public to share with the community.

<Note>
Start with a pre-built persona and modify it to create your own customized version. This is often easier than starting from scratch.
