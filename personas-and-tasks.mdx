## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Persona Instructions

- **Be specific**: "You are a helpful math tutor" is better than "You are helpful"
- **Define the role**: Explain what the persona should do
- **Set the tone**: Specify how the persona should communicate
- **Include examples**: Show the persona how to respond

**Good Example:**
"You are a friendly coding tutor. Explain programming concepts in simple terms, use code examples, and encourage questions. Break down complex topics into smaller parts."

### Creating Useful Tasks

- **Define clear steps**: Each step should have a specific purpose
- **Ask for specific information**: Request the exact details you need
- **Provide structure**: Guide users through the process logically
- **Include examples**: Show users what kind of input you expect

**Good Example:**
```
1. Ask: "What is the topic of your essay?"
2. Ask: "What is your main argument?"
3. Ask: "What are three supporting points?"
4. Generate an essay outline based on the responses
5. Ask: "Would you like me to expand any section?"
```

### Organizing Personas and Tasks

- **Use descriptive names**: Make it easy to identify each persona or task
- **Group by purpose**: Organize related personas and tasks together
- **Archive unused items**: Keep your list clean and organized
- **Share with team**: Make useful personas and tasks available to others

<Tip>
Start with pre-built personas and tasks to understand how they work, then create your own customized versions for your specific needs.
