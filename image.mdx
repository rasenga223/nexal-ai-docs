4. Choose image size (square, wide, or tall)
5. Select a style preset (optional)

**On Web:**

5. Select a style preset (optional)
6. Click Generate
7. Wait 10-30 seconds for your image

### Understanding Image Sizes

- **Square** (1:1): Perfect for social media posts, profile pictures
- **Wide** (16:9): Great for wallpapers, banners, presentations

## Image Generation Tips

### Writing Effective Prompts

The better you describe what you want, the better the result!

**Good Prompt Examples:**
- "A serene mountain landscape at sunrise, with snow-capped peaks, a calm lake in the foreground reflecting the mountains, soft pink and orange sky, photorealistic style"
- "A cute cartoon robot with big eyes, holding a flower, pastel colors, simple background, friendly expression"

### Prompt Structure

1. **Subject**: What is the main focus? (e.g., "a cat")
2. **Details**: Add specifics (e.g., "orange tabby cat, sitting")
3. **Setting**: Where is it? (e.g., "on a windowsill")
4. **Style**: How should it look? (e.g., "photorealistic, soft lighting")
5. **Mood**: What feeling? (e.g., "peaceful, warm")

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too vague**: "a picture" → Better: "a picture of a sunset over mountains"
- **Too many conflicting ideas**: Keep it focused
- **Forgetting style**: Always specify realistic, artistic, cartoon, etc.

### Using Style Presets

Style presets help you get consistent results:

1. Tap or click "Style" before generating
2. Select a preset
3. Your prompt automatically includes style instructions
4. Generate your image
