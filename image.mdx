## Getting Started with Image Generation


### What is AI Image Generation?

Describe what you want to see, and AI creates it! No drawing skills needed - just describe your vision in words, and watch it come to life.

### How to Generate Your First Image


Generate images directly within your conversations:

**On Mobile:**
1. In any chat, type `/image` or ask the AI to create an image
2. Describe what you want
3. The AI generates the image in the conversation
4. View, save, or share directly from chat

**On Web:**
1. Ask the AI to create an image in your conversation
2. Describe what you want
3. The image appears in your chat
4. Click to view full size, download, or regenerate

## Image-to-Image Generation

Transform existing images or use them as a starting point for new creations. Upload an image and modify it with AI.

### How It Works

**On Mobile:**
1. In any chat, type `/image` or ask the AI to create an image
2. Tap the image attachment icon to upload a reference image
3. Describe the changes you want to make
4. The AI modifies or reimagines your image
5. View, save, or share the result

**On Web:**
1. Ask the AI to modify or create an image
2. Upload your reference image by dragging and dropping or clicking to browse
3. Describe your desired changes or style
4. The AI generates a new version based on your input

### Image-to-Image Use Cases

**Style Transfer:**
- "Make this photo look like a watercolor painting"
- "Convert this image to anime style"
- "Transform this into a pencil sketch"

**Modifications:**
- "Change the background to a beach scene"
- "Add snow to this landscape"
- "Make this daytime photo look like nighttime"

**Variations:**
- "Create a similar scene but with different colors"
- "Generate a version of this in a futuristic style"
- "Reimagine this composition with different elements"

### Understanding Aspect Ratios

Choose the right aspect ratio for your use case:

- **Square (1:1)**: Perfect for social media posts, profile pictures
- **Wide (16:9)**: Great for wallpapers, banners, presentations
- **Tall (9:16)**: Ideal for mobile wallpapers, stories, vertical content
- **Standard (4:3)**: Classic photo ratio, versatile for many uses
- **Portrait (3:4)**: Good for portraits and vertical compositions

### Output Formats

**Available Formats:**
- **PNG**: High quality, supports transparency
- **JPEG**: Smaller file size, good for photos
- **WebP**: Modern format, excellent compression

## Image Generation Tips

### Writing Effective Prompts

The better you describe what you want, the better the result!

**Good Prompt Examples:**
- "A serene mountain landscape at sunrise, with snow-capped peaks, a calm lake in the foreground reflecting the mountains, soft pink and orange sky, photorealistic style"
- "A cute cartoon robot with big eyes, holding a flower, pastel colors, simple background, friendly expression"

### Prompt Structure

1. **Subject**: What is the main focus? (e.g., "a cat")
2. **Details**: Add specifics (e.g., "orange tabby cat, sitting")
3. **Setting**: Where is it? (e.g., "on a windowsill")
4. **Style**: How should it look? (e.g., "photorealistic, soft lighting")
5. **Mood**: What feeling? (e.g., "peaceful, warm")

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too vague**: "a picture" → Better: "a picture of a sunset over mountains"
- **Too many conflicting ideas**: Keep it focused
- **Forgetting style**: Always specify realistic, artistic, cartoon, etc.

### Style Presets

Style presets help you get consistent results:

**Available Styles:**
- **Realistic**: Photorealistic images
- **Artistic**: Paintings and artistic styles
- **Anime**: Anime and manga style
- **3D Render**: 3D rendered graphics
- **Sketch**: Hand-drawn sketch style
- **Digital Art**: Modern digital artwork
