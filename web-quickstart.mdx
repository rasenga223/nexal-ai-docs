## Select a Persona

Personas are specialized AI assistants tailored for specific tasks and roles. They come pre-configured with the right instructions and settings for their domain.

Try it out:

1. Click the persona selector in the chat interface
2. Browse available personas like "Code Assistant", "Creative Writer", or "Data Analyst"
3. Select a persona that matches your task
4. Start chatting - the persona will adapt its responses to its specialized role

The persona uses the best instructions and settings for its purpose, so you can focus on getting work done.

## Use Tools

Tools extend the AI's capabilities beyond text generation. Type `/` in the chat input to see available tools, or just describe what you need and the AI will use the right tool automatically.

Ask the AI to:

- Generate images from text descriptions
- Search the web for up-to-date information
- Create documents and resumes
- Save memories for future conversations

## Generate Images

Create stunning images from text descriptions using our AI image generation.

Let's create your first image:

1. Ask the AI to generate an image: "Create a futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars"
2. The AI will generate the image in the conversation
3. Click to view full size, download, or regenerate with different parameters

<Note>
  Be specific in your prompts - include details about style, mood, colors, and composition for best results.
</Note>

## Thinking Mode

For complex problems, enable Thinking Mode to see the AI's reasoning process step-by-step. This helps you understand how the AI arrives at its answers and ensures more thorough analysis.

Enable it from the chat settings or by asking the AI to "think through this step by step."
