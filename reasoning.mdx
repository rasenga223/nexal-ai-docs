## What is Reasoning?

Reasoning controls how much thinking the AI does before it answers. More reasoning means the AI works through the problem step-by-step, like showing its work in math class.

## Why It Matters

Some questions are simple: "What's 2+2?" The AI doesn't need to think hard about that.

Other questions are complex: "Design a database schema for a social media app." For that, you want the AI to think through all the edge cases and trade-offs.

Reasoning lets you control which approach to use.

## Reasoning Levels

**Low:** Fast responses, minimal thinking. Good for straightforward questions.

**Medium:** Balanced approach. The AI thinks a bit before answering. Works for most questions.

**High:** Deep thinking. The AI works through the problem methodically. Best for complex problems.

## When to Use Each Level

### Low Reasoning

- Simple facts ("What year did this happen?")
- Quick definitions
- Basic calculations
- When you just need a fast answer

### Medium Reasoning

- Most everyday questions
- Explanations of concepts
- General advice
- Default for most conversations

### High Reasoning

- Complex problem-solving
- Debugging tricky code
- Analyzing multiple options
- When accuracy is critical
- Math problems with many steps
- Architecture decisions

## How to Control Reasoning

### On Web

Look for the reasoning controls in your chat interface. You can usually find them in the settings or options menu.

### On Mobile

Go to the chat settings and adjust the reasoning level before you start your conversation.

## What You'll Notice

**With low reasoning:**
- Faster responses
- More direct answers
- Sometimes less thorough

**With high reasoning:**
- Slower (but more thoughtful) responses
- The AI might show you its thinking process
- More comprehensive answers
- Better for complex topics

## Thinking Mode (Web)

On web, there's also a Thinking Mode that shows you the AI's reasoning process as it works through your question. It's like watching the AI think out loud.

This is great for:
- Understanding how the AI solved a problem
- Learning problem-solving approaches
- Verifying the logic behind an answer

## Plan Availability

Reasoning controls are available on most paid plans:

| Plan | Reasoning Controls |
|------|-------------------|
| Free | No |
| Lite | Yes |
| Plus | Yes |
| Pro | Yes |
| Max | Yes |

<Note>
Start with medium reasoning for most things. Dial it up to high when you hit a tough problem, and turn it down to low when you just need quick facts.
