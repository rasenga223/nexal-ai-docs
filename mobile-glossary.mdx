## A

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, like understanding language and generating content.

**AI Model**: A specific AI system designed for particular tasks. Different models have different strengths (e.g., GPT-5 Mini for general tasks, Grok 4 Fast for cost-efficient multimodal tasks).

**Aspect Ratio**: The proportional relationship between width and height of an image. Common ratios include 1:1 (square), 16:9 (wide), and 9:16 (tall).

## B

**Batch Generation**: Creating multiple variations of an image at once.

## C

**CFG Scale**: Classifier Free Guidance scale - a parameter in image generation that controls how closely the AI follows your prompt. Higher values mean stricter adherence to the prompt.

**Context Window**: The maximum number of tokens (words or word pieces) a model can process in a single conversation, including both input and output.

**Conversation**: A chat session with an AI assistant. Can contain multiple messages back and forth.

## D

**Daily Limit**: The maximum number of times you can use a feature per day. Limits reset at midnight in your local timezone.

**Document Processing**: The ability to upload and analyze documents (PDFs, images, etc.) to extract information or answer questions.

## E

**Export**: Downloading your data from Nexal AI, including conversations, images, and other content.

## G

**Generation**: Creating new content (images, text) using AI.

**Guidance**: A parameter that controls how closely the AI follows your prompt when generating images.

## M

**Memory**: A tool that allows the AI to save and recall important information about you across conversations. Memories persist across all chats and help personalize your experience.

**Model**: See AI Model.

## N

**Negative Prompt**: In image generation, a description of what you don't want to appear in the output.

## P

**Persona**: A pre-configured AI assistant with specific instructions and personality traits for particular tasks.

**Premium Model**: Advanced AI models that provide better quality and accuracy but may have usage limits. Examples include GPT-5, Grok 4, and Gemini Pro.

**Prompt**: The text you write to tell the AI what you want. Better prompts = better results!

**Prompt Engineering**: The skill of writing effective prompts to get the best AI responses.

## R

**Rapid Mode**: Speed over depth. Makes the AI respond faster by skipping the deep thinking. Type `!rapid` before your message to use it.

**Reasoning**: How much the AI thinks before answering. Low = fast and simple. High = slow and thorough. Most questions work fine with Medium.

**Reminder**: A mobile tool that schedules notifications for future tasks or events.

## S

**Streaming**: When AI responses appear word-by-word in real-time, rather than all at once.

**Style Preset**: Pre-configured settings that apply a specific visual style to generated images (e.g., realistic, anime, sketch).

**Subscription Plan**: Your chosen pricing tier (Free, Lite, Plus, Pro, or Max) that determines your features and limits.

## T

**Text-to-Image**: Generating images from text descriptions using AI.

**Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converting text to spoken audio. Used in voice features to have the AI speak responses.

**Thinking Mode**: An advanced chat mode that shows the AI's reasoning process for complex problems.

**Tool**: A capability that extends the AI beyond text generation, such as web search, image generation, or document creation.

**Token**: A unit of text that AI models process. Roughly equivalent to a word or part of a word.

## V

**Vision**: The ability of an AI model to understand and analyze images. Models with vision can describe pictures, read text in images, and answer questions about visual content.

**Voice Mode**: A mobile feature that allows hands-free conversation with the AI using speech-to-text and text-to-speech.

## W

**Web Search**: A tool that allows the AI to search the internet for current information when answering questions.
