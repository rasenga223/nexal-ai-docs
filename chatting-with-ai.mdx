### How to Start a Chat

**On Web:**
1. Open the Chat section
2. Click in the message input at the bottom

### Understanding AI Responses

- AI responses appear word-by-word (streaming) for a natural conversation feel
- Responses are formatted with proper paragraphs and structure
- You can copy, share, or regenerate any response
- Long-press (mobile) or right-click (web) on a message to see options

- **Use examples**: "Write a professional email like this: [example]"
