## Understanding Premium Models

### What Are Premium Models?

Premium models are advanced AI systems that provide better results but require more computing resources. Examples include GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, Grok 4, and Gemini Pro.

### Free Models vs Premium Models

Free models provide fast responses and are great for general tasks. Premium models offer better quality, accuracy, and are ideal for complex tasks requiring advanced reasoning.

<Tip>
Start with free models for simple tasks, and save your premium model messages for when you really need the extra quality and accuracy.
