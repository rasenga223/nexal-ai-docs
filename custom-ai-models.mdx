## What Are Custom Models?

### Simple Explanation

A custom AI model is like training your own personal AI assistant using your own documents and knowledge. Instead of using general knowledge, your custom model knows only what you teach it.

### When to Create One

- **Company Knowledge Base**: Train an AI on your company documents
- **Personal Assistant**: Create an AI that knows your preferences and information
- **Specialized Domain**: Train an AI on specific topics (medical, legal, technical)
- **Research Assistant**: Upload research papers and ask questions

### Real-World Examples

- A lawyer creates a model trained on case law
- A student creates a model from their textbook
- A business creates a model from their documentation
- A researcher creates a model from their papers

## Creating Your Own AI

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Prepare Your Documents

- Gather PDFs, Word docs, or text files
- Organize them by topic
- Make sure they're relevant to your model's purpose

<Tip>
More documents = better knowledge base. Aim for at least 5-10 relevant documents for best results.
</Tip>

#### 2. Create the Model

**On Mobile:**
1. Go to Settings → Custom Models
2. Tap "Create New Model"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "My Research Assistant")
4. Write a description

**On Web:**
1. Go to Settings → Custom Models
2. Click "Create New Model"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "My Research Assistant")
4. Write a description

#### 3. Choose a Base Model

- Select from available AI models
- GPT-4 recommended for best results
- This determines the AI's capabilities

**Base Model Options:**
- **GPT-4**: Best for complex reasoning and analysis
- **Claude Sonnet**: Excellent for long-form content and writing
- **Gemini Pro**: Great for technical and creative tasks

#### 4. Upload Knowledge Base

**On Mobile:**
1. Tap "Add Documents"
2. Select files from your device
3. Wait for processing (may take a few minutes)
4. Documents are converted to searchable knowledge

**On Web:**
1. Click "Add Documents"
2. Select files from your computer
3. Wait for processing (may take a few minutes)
4. Documents are converted to searchable knowledge

#### 5. Test Your Model

1. Start a chat with your custom model
2. Ask questions related to your documents
3. Verify it answers correctly
4. Refine if needed

#### 6. Use Your Model

1. Access it from the Chat tab or section
2. Select it like any other model
3. Ask questions using your knowledge base!

### Training Tips

- **More documents = better knowledge base**: Upload as many relevant documents as possible
- **Organize documents by topic**: Group related documents together
- **Remove irrelevant information**: Clean up documents before uploading
- **Update regularly**: Add new documents as your knowledge base grows

### Model Limits

- **Free Plan**: No custom models
- **Plus Plan**: Up to 200 custom models
- **Max Plan**: Unlimited custom models

## Sharing Models

### Public vs Private Models

**Private Models** (Default):
- Only you can use them
- Your documents stay private
- Perfect for personal use

**Public Models:**
- Anyone can use them
- Share with friends, team, or community
- Great for collaborative projects

### How to Share

**On Mobile:**
1. Go to Settings → Custom Models
2. Select your model
3. Toggle "Public" on
4. Share the model name or link
5. Others can now use it!

**On Web:**
1. Go to Settings → Custom Models
2. Select your model
3. Toggle "Public" on
4. Share the model name or link
5. Others can now use it!

### Privacy Note

- When you make a model public, others can ask questions
- They cannot see your original documents
- They only see answers based on your knowledge base

<Tip>
Before making a model public, review your documents to ensure they don't contain sensitive information you don't want others to access indirectly.
</Tip>

## Managing Your Models

### Editing Models

**On Mobile:**
1. Go to Settings → Custom Models
2. Tap on a model
3. Tap "Edit"
4. Modify name, description, or documents
5. Save changes

**On Web:**
1. Go to Settings → Custom Models
2. Click on a model
3. Click "Edit"
4. Modify name, description, or documents
5. Save changes

### Adding More Documents

1. Select your model
2. Tap or click "Add Documents"
3. Upload new files
4. Wait for processing
5. Your model now includes the new information

### Removing Documents

1. Select your model
2. Go to "Knowledge Base"
3. Remove documents you no longer want
4. Your model updates automatically

### Deleting Models

**On Mobile:**
1. Go to Settings → Custom Models
2. Long-press on a model
3. Tap "Delete"
4. Confirm deletion

**On Web:**
1. Go to Settings → Custom Models
2. Right-click on a model
3. Select "Delete"
4. Confirm deletion

<Tip>
Deleting a model permanently removes it and its knowledge base. Make sure you have backups of important documents.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Document Quality

- **Use clear, well-structured documents**: Documents with headings and clear organization work best
- **Avoid scanned images**: Use text-based PDFs when possible
- **Keep documents relevant**: Only upload documents related to your model's purpose
- **Update regularly**: Add new information as it becomes available

### Model Naming

- Use descriptive names: "Company Policy Assistant" is better than "Model 1"
- Include the topic or purpose
- Make it easy to identify at a glance

### Testing Your Model

- **Start with simple questions**: Test basic functionality first
- **Ask about specific content**: Verify it can find information from your documents
- **Test edge cases**: Try questions about topics not in your documents
- **Refine based on results**: Add more documents if needed

### Organizing Multiple Models

- Create models for different topics or purposes
- Use folders or naming conventions to organize
- Archive or delete models you no longer use

## Use Cases

### Business Applications

- **Company Knowledge Base**: Train on company documentation, policies, and procedures
- **Customer Support**: Create models trained on product documentation and FAQs
- **Internal Training**: Build models from training materials and guides

### Educational Applications

- **Study Assistant**: Upload textbooks and course materials
- **Research Helper**: Train on research papers and articles
- **Subject Expert**: Create models for specific academic subjects

### Personal Applications

- **Personal Knowledge Base**: Upload your notes, articles, and resources
- **Project Assistant**: Train on project-specific documents
- **Learning Tool**: Create models from educational content

<Tip>
Custom models work best when they have a clear, focused purpose. Instead of one large model covering everything, consider creating multiple specialized models.
