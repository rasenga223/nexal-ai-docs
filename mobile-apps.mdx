## What are Mini-Apps?

Mini-apps are lightweight, custom applications you can build directly in Nexal AI just by describing what you want. Create tools, calculators, forms, and interactive experiences through conversation with the AI.

<Note>
**Availability**: Mobile only (iOS and Android)
</Note>

## How to Access Apps

**On Mobile:**
1. Open the Nexal AI app
2. Tap the Apps tab in the bottom navigation
3. Browse existing mini-apps or create your own
4. Tap "Create New App" to start

## Creating Your First Mini-App

Apps are created through AI chat conversation. You describe what you want, and the AI builds it for you.

### How It Works

1. **Start a New App**
   - Tap "Create New App" in the Apps tab
   - You'll enter a chat interface with the AI
   - Describe what you want to build

2. **Tell the AI What You Need**
   - Be specific about what your app should do
   - Example: "Create a tip calculator that splits bills between people"
   - Example: "Build a daily mood tracker with ratings from 1-10"
   - Example: "Make a workout timer with custom intervals"

3. **Refine and Adjust**
   - The AI will build your app and show you a preview
   - Ask for changes if needed: "Make the buttons bigger" or "Add a reset button"
   - Keep chatting until it's exactly what you want

4. **Use Your App**
   - Once you're happy with it, your app is ready to use
   - It appears in your Apps list
   - Open it anytime you need it

## Mini-App Examples

Here are some apps you can create just by describing them:

**Tip Calculator**: "Build a tip calculator that lets me split bills between friends"

**Habit Tracker**: "Create a habit tracker where I can check off daily goals"

**Unit Converter**: "Make a converter for common cooking measurements"

**Budget Tracker**: "Build a simple expense tracker with categories"

**Study Timer**: "Create a pomodoro timer with 25-minute work sessions"

**Recipe Scaler**: "Make a recipe ingredient scaler that adjusts servings"

## Tips for Creating Apps

**Be specific**: Instead of "make a calculator," try "create a mortgage calculator with principal, interest rate, and term"

**Start simple**: Get the basic version working first, then add features

**Ask for changes**: If something isn't right, just tell the AI what to fix

**Give examples**: "Make it look like [describe style]" or "Similar to [reference]"

<Note>
The AI understands what you want to build. Just describe your app in plain language like you're talking to a developer. You don't need technical knowledge.
</Note>

## Using Your Mini-Apps

Once created, your apps live in the Apps tab. Tap any app to open and use it. Apps are built to be quick and focused on one task - perfect for things you do often.

If you want to update an app later, you can create a new version through chat.
