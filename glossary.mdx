## A

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, like understanding language and generating content.

**AI Model**: A specific AI system designed for particular tasks. Different models have different strengths (e.g., GPT-5 Mini for general tasks, Grok 4 Fast for cost-efficient multimodal tasks).



## B

**Batch Generation**: Creating multiple variations of an image or video at once.

**Base Model**: The underlying AI model used when creating a custom model. Determines the capabilities of your custom model.

## C

**Custom Model**: A personalized AI assistant you create by combining a base model with custom instructions and a knowledge base. Uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to access your specific data.

**Conversation**: A chat session with an AI assistant. Can contain multiple messages back and forth.

## D

**Daily Limit**: The maximum number of times you can use a feature per day. Limits reset at midnight in your local timezone.

**Document Processing**: The ability to upload and analyze documents (PDFs, Word docs, etc.) to extract information or answer questions.

## E

**Embedding**: A mathematical representation of text that captures its meaning, used for semantic search.

**Export**: Downloading your data from Nexal AI, including conversations, images, and other content.

## G

**Generation**: Creating new content (images, videos, text) using AI.

## K

**Knowledge Base**: A collection of documents and data that a custom AI model references using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to provide personalized responses.

## M

**Model**: See AI Model.

## P

**Persona**: A pre-configured AI assistant with specific instructions and personality traits for particular tasks.

**Premium Model**: Advanced AI models that provide better quality and accuracy but may have usage limits. Examples include GPT-5, Grok 4, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite.

**Prompt**: The text you write to tell the AI what you want. Better prompts = better results!

**Prompt Engineering**: The skill of writing effective prompts to get the best AI responses.

## S

**Semantic Search**: Searching by meaning rather than exact keywords. Finds relevant content even if words don't match exactly.

**Streaming**: When AI responses appear word-by-word in real-time, rather than all at once.

**Subscription Plan**: Your chosen pricing tier (Free, Plus, or Max) that determines your features and limits.

## T


**Text-to-Image**: Generating images from text descriptions using AI.

**Text-to-Video**: Generating videos from text descriptions using AI.


## V

**Vector Storage**: A way of storing and searching documents by their meaning, used in custom models and semantic search.

## Additional Terms

**Claude**: A family of AI models developed by Anthropic. Includes Claude 3.5 Haiku and other variants.

**Gemini**: A family of AI models developed by Google. Includes Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite, Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, and Gemma 3 27B.

**Grok**: AI models developed by xAI. Includes Grok 4 Fast (multimodal with 2M token context) and Grok 3 Mini.

**GPT**: AI models developed by OpenAI. Includes GPT-5 Mini, GPT-5 Nano, and GPT-4.1 Nano.

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: A technique used in custom models where the AI retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base before generating responses, providing more accurate and personalized answers.


**OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Technology that converts scanned images of text into editable text.
