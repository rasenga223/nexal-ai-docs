## A

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, like understanding language and generating content.

**AI Model**: A specific AI system trained for particular tasks. Different models have different strengths (e.g., GPT-4 for reasoning, Claude for writing).

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A way for different software to communicate. In Nexal, API access lets you use AI features in your own applications.

## B

**Batch Generation**: Creating multiple variations of an image or video at once.

**Base Model**: The underlying AI model used when creating a custom model. Determines the capabilities of your custom model.

## C

**Custom Model**: An AI model you create by training it on your own documents and knowledge base.

**Conversation**: A chat session with an AI assistant. Can contain multiple messages back and forth.

## D

**Daily Limit**: The maximum number of times you can use a feature per day. Limits reset at midnight in your local timezone.

**Document Processing**: The ability to upload and analyze documents (PDFs, Word docs, etc.) to extract information or answer questions.

## E

**Embedding**: A mathematical representation of text that captures its meaning, used for semantic search.

**Export**: Downloading your data from Nexal AI, including conversations, images, and other content.

## G

**Generation**: Creating new content (images, videos, text) using AI.

**GPT-3.5**: A free AI model good for general questions and everyday tasks.

**GPT-4**: A premium AI model excellent for complex reasoning, analysis, and detailed explanations.

## K

**Knowledge Base**: A collection of documents used to train a custom AI model.

## M

**Model**: See AI Model.

## P

**Persona**: A pre-configured AI assistant with specific instructions and personality traits for particular tasks.

**Premium Model**: Advanced AI models (like GPT-4) that provide better results but may have usage limits.

**Prompt**: The text you write to tell the AI what you want. Better prompts = better results!

**Prompt Engineering**: The skill of writing effective prompts to get the best AI responses.

## S

**Semantic Search**: Searching by meaning rather than exact keywords. Finds relevant content even if words don't match exactly.

**Streaming**: When AI responses appear word-by-word in real-time, rather than all at once.

**Subscription Plan**: Your chosen pricing tier (Free, Plus, Max, or Lifetime Plus) that determines your features and limits.

## T

**Task**: A pre-configured workflow that guides you and the AI through a complete process (e.g., writing an email, creating a report).

**Text-to-Image**: Generating images from text descriptions using AI.

**Text-to-Video**: Generating videos from text descriptions using AI.

## U

**Usage Statistics**: Information about how many messages, images, and videos you've used in a given period.

## V

**Vector Storage**: A way of storing and searching documents by their meaning, used in custom models and semantic search.

## Additional Terms

**Claude**: A family of AI models developed by Anthropic. Includes Claude Haiku (fast, free) and Claude Sonnet (premium, advanced).

**Gemini**: A family of AI models developed by Google. Includes Gemini Flash (fast, free) and Gemini Pro (premium, advanced).

**OAuth**: A secure authentication method used for Google and Apple sign-in.

**OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Technology that converts scanned images of text into editable text.

**RLS (Row Level Security)**: Security feature that ensures users can only access their own data.

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Encryption protocol used to secure data in transit.

**AES-256**: Advanced encryption standard used to secure data at rest.
