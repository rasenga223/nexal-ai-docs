## Slow Responses

### Why Responses Might Be Slow

- Premium models are slower but more accurate
- Network connection speed affects response time
- High server load during peak times

### How to Speed Things Up

- Use free models for faster responses
- Simplify your questions
- Check your internet connection

<Tip>
Free models like GPT-3.5 and Claude Haiku respond much faster than premium models. Use them when speed is more important than quality.
