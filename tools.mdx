## What Are Tools?

Tools let the AI do things beyond answering questions. It can search the web, generate images, create documents, set reminders - basically anything that requires an action.

## Available Tools

### Web Tools

**Resume Generator**
- Turn your experience into a formatted resume
- Export it when you're done

**Image Generation**
- Create images right in your chat
- Just describe what you want

**Document Generator**
- Write and edit documents (reports, letters, proposals, etc.)
- Built-in editor for formatting
- Export as DOCX

**Memory**
- The AI remembers things about you across conversations
- You never have to repeat your preferences

### Mobile Tools

**Image Generation**
- Same as web - create images on the go
- Multiple AI models to choose from

**Document Generator**
- Create and edit documents from your phone
- All the same document types as web

**Memory**
- Same memory system as web
- Your preferences follow you everywhere

**Reminder**
- Set reminders with push notifications
- One-time or repeating (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Timezone support

**Web Search**
- Get current information from the internet
- Results come with sources
- Good for news, weather, real-time data

**Folder Access**
- Upload files to project folders
- The AI can read and reference them in chat

## Using Tools

Most of the time, you don't need to do anything special. Just describe what you want and the AI picks the right tool:

- "Create an image of a sunset" → Image generation
- "Remember that my favorite color is blue" → Memory
- "Remind me to call mom tomorrow at 3pm" → Reminder (mobile)
- "What's the weather in Tokyo?" → Web search

If you want to be explicit, type `/` in the chat and you'll see a list of available tools.

## Quick Triggers

**On Web:**
- `!web` + space: Force web search for your message
- `!rapid` + space: Use rapid mode (faster responses)

**On Mobile:**
- `@`: Pick a persona
- `/`: Pick a tool

## Memory Tool

Tell the AI something once, and it remembers forever (or until you delete it).

"Remember that I prefer Python over JavaScript"

That's it. Next time you ask for code, it'll use Python without you having to specify.

**Viewing memories:**
- Mobile: Memories screen
- Web: Settings → Memories

**Deleting memories:**
Just swipe (mobile) or click (web) and delete. You can't edit them though - if something changes, delete the old one and tell the AI the new info.

## Reminder Tool (Mobile Only)

Set reminders and get push notifications:

"Remind me to submit the report on Friday at 2pm"
"Set a daily reminder to take my vitamins at 8am"

You can see all your reminders in the Reminders section and mark them complete when you're done.

## Document Generator

**On Web and Mobile:**

Ask the AI to write something:

"Write a project proposal for a new mobile app"
"Create a cover letter for a software engineer position"

It generates the document, then you can edit it in the built-in editor and export it as DOCX when you're happy with it.

## Resume Generator (Web Only)

Tell the AI about your experience and it formats everything into a proper resume. You can review and edit before exporting.

## A Few Tips

Be specific when asking for something. "Create a professional email about the delay" is better than "write an email."

If the first result isn't quite right, just ask for changes. The AI can iterate on its work.

<Note>
The AI usually picks the right tool automatically. You only need to explicitly choose one if you want to override its decision.
