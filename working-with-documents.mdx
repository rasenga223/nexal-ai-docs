## Document Features

### Summarizing Documents

Get quick summaries of long documents:

1. Upload your document
2. Type: "Summarize this document"
3. The AI will:
   - Read the entire document
   - Extract key points
   - Provide a concise summary

**Example Prompts:**
- "Summarize this document"
- "Give me a brief overview"
- "What are the main points?"
- "Create a bullet-point summary"

### Asking Questions About Documents

Have a question about your document? Just ask!

1. Upload your document
2. Ask questions like:
   - "What are the main points?"
   - "What does page 5 say about [topic]?"
   - "Summarize the conclusion"
   - "What data is presented in the charts?"

**Example Questions:**
- "What is the main argument in this paper?"
- "What are the key findings?"
- "Explain the methodology used"
- "What are the recommendations?"

### Extracting Information

Need specific information?

1. Upload your document
2. Ask specific questions:
   - "What are all the dates mentioned?"
   - "List all the names"
   - "What are the key statistics?"
   - "Extract all email addresses"

**Extraction Examples:**
- "Find all the dates in this document"
- "List all the people mentioned"
- "What are the key numbers and statistics?"
- "Extract all the contact information"

### Semantic Search

Search your documents by meaning, not just keywords:

1. Upload multiple documents
2. Ask: "Find information about [topic]"
3. The AI searches across all documents
4. Finds relevant sections even if they don't use exact keywords

**Semantic Search Examples:**
- "Find information about climate change"
- "What does this say about renewable energy?"
- "Where is customer satisfaction discussed?"

<Tip>
Semantic search understands context and meaning, so you can ask questions in natural language without needing exact keywords from the document.
</Tip>

### Creating Knowledge Bases

Build a custom AI model from your documents:

1. Upload multiple related documents
2. Go to Settings → Custom Models
3. Create a new model
4. Add your documents as the knowledge base
5. Your custom AI can now answer questions using only your documents!

Learn more about creating custom models in our [Custom AI Models guide](/custom-ai-models).

## Website Summarization

### How to Summarize a Website

   - Extract key information
   - Provide a summary

**On Web:**

   - Fetch the website content
   - Extract key information
   - Provide a summary

### Best Use Cases

### Tips

- Make sure the URL is publicly accessible
- Some websites may block automated access
- For best results, use direct article URLs

- "Summarize this article: [URL]"
- "What is this page about?"
- "Extract the key points from this website"
- "What are the main takeaways?"

## Working with Multiple Documents

### Comparing Documents

Ask questions across multiple documents:

1. Upload multiple documents
2. Ask comparative questions:
   - "Compare the conclusions of these documents"
   - "What are the differences between these reports?"
   - "What do these documents agree on?"

### Cross-Document Analysis

Find connections across documents:

1. Upload related documents
2. Ask: "What themes appear across all these documents?"
3. The AI analyzes patterns and connections
4. Get insights that span multiple documents

## Document Best Practices

### Preparing Documents

- **Clear text**: Scanned PDFs may need OCR (optical character recognition)
- **Well-structured**: Documents with clear headings work best
- **Relevant content**: Upload documents related to your questions

### Asking Effective Questions

- **Be specific**: "What does the report say about Q4 sales?" is better than "Tell me about sales"
- **Reference sections**: "What does the conclusion section say?"
- **Ask follow-ups**: Build on previous answers
- **Use context**: Reference previous parts of the conversation

### Organizing Documents

- Use folders to organize document-related conversations
- Name conversations based on the document topic
- Archive old document analyses to keep things organized

<Tip>
For best results with long documents, break your questions into smaller, specific queries rather than asking for everything at once.
</Tip>

## Privacy and Security

### Document Privacy

- Documents are processed securely
- Files are encrypted in transit and at rest
- Your documents are only used to answer your questions
- Documents are not shared with other users

### Data Handling

- Documents are stored securely on our servers
- You can delete document attachments at any time
- Deleted documents are permanently removed
- Export your data if needed (Settings → Privacy → Export My Data)

<Tip>
For sensitive documents, consider using private custom models rather than general chat. This ensures your documents are only used for your specific model.
