3. Describe what you want (e.g., "a futuristic city at sunset")
4. Choose image size (square, wide, or tall)

5. Select a style preset (optional)
6. Click Generate
7. Wait 10-30 seconds for your image

### Understanding Image Sizes

- **Square** (1:1): Perfect for social media posts, profile pictures
- **Wide** (16:9): Great for wallpapers, banners, presentations
- **Tall** (9:16): Ideal for mobile wallpapers, stories

### Style Presets

Choose a style to match your vision:

- **Realistic**: Photorealistic images
- **Artistic**: Paintings and artistic styles
- **Anime**: Anime and manga style
- **3D Render**: 3D rendered graphics
- **Sketch**: Hand-drawn sketch style

## Image Generation Tips

### Writing Effective Prompts

The better you describe what you want, the better the result!

**Good Prompt Examples:**
- "A serene mountain landscape at sunrise, with snow-capped peaks, a calm lake in the foreground reflecting the mountains, soft pink and orange sky, photorealistic style"
- "A cute cartoon robot with big eyes, holding a flower, pastel colors, simple background, friendly expression"

### Prompt Structure

1. **Subject**: What is the main focus? (e.g., "a cat")
2. **Details**: Add specifics (e.g., "orange tabby cat, sitting")
3. **Setting**: Where is it? (e.g., "on a windowsill")
4. **Style**: How should it look? (e.g., "photorealistic, soft lighting")
5. **Mood**: What feeling? (e.g., "peaceful, warm")

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too vague**: "a picture" → Better: "a picture of a sunset over mountains"
- **Too many conflicting ideas**: Keep it focused
- **Forgetting style**: Always specify realistic, artistic, cartoon, etc.

### Using Style Presets

1. Tap or click "Style" before generating
