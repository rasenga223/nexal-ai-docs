## Start Your First Chat

Begin your conversation with simple questions or tasks. Our AI assistants are designed to be helpful and easy to talk to.

### Example Prompts

- "Help me write a professional email"
- "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
- "Create a weekly meal plan for my family"

## Select a Persona

Personas are specialized AI assistants tailored for specific tasks and roles. They come pre-configured with the right instructions and settings for their domain.

Try it out:

1. Open the persona selector in the chat interface
2. Browse available personas like "Code Assistant", "Creative Writer", or "Data Analyst"
3. Select a persona that matches your task
4. Start chatting - the persona will adapt its responses to its specialized role

The persona uses the best instructions and settings for its purpose, so you can focus on getting work done.

## Use Tools

Tools extend the AI's capabilities beyond text generation. Ask the AI to:

- Generate images from text descriptions
- Search the web for up-to-date information
- Create documents and resumes
- Save memories for future conversations
- Set reminders (mobile only)

Type `/` in the chat input to see available tools, or just describe what you need and the AI will use the right tool automatically.

## Generate Images

Create stunning images from text descriptions using our AI image generation.

Let's create your first image:

1. Navigate to the Generate section (Image tab)
2. Enter a descriptive prompt, for example: "A futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars"
3. Select your preferred model, style, size, and settings
4. Click **Generate**

Your image will appear in seconds. You can refine it by adjusting the prompt or regenerating with different parameters.

<Tip>
  Be specific in your prompts - include details about style, mood, colors, and composition for best results.

## Voice Conversations (Mobile)

On mobile, you can have voice conversations with the AI:

1. Tap the microphone icon in the chat
2. Speak your question or message
3. The AI will respond with both text and voice
4. Continue the conversation naturally

Voice mode is great for hands-free interactions when you're on the go.

## Explore More Features (Mobile)

On mobile, you'll find additional features:

**Apps**: Create custom mini-apps with a visual builder - no coding required. Build calculators, forms, trackers, and more.

**Memories**: Save important information that the AI remembers across all conversations for a more personalized experience.
