Chatting with AI in Nexal is as simple as texting a friend, but much more powerful!

### How to Start a Chat

### Understanding AI Responses

- AI responses appear word-by-word (streaming) for a natural conversation feel
- Responses are formatted with proper paragraphs, code blocks, and structure
- You can copy, share, or regenerate any response

- **Use examples**: "Write a professional email like this: [example]"
