## Video Generation Basics

### What is AI Video Generation?

Describe a scene or action, and AI creates a short video clip! Perfect for social media, presentations, or creative projects.

### How Text-to-Video Works

1. You describe what you want to see
2. AI interprets your description
3. Video is generated frame-by-frame
4. You get a short video clip (usually 5-10 seconds)

### Generating Your First Video

**On Mobile:**
1. Open the Generate tab
2. Switch to "Video" mode
3. Describe your video (e.g., "a cat playing with a ball of yarn")
4. Set video parameters:
   - **Dimensions**: Width and height (e.g., 1280x720)
   - **Duration**: How long (5-10 seconds)
   - **Steps**: Quality level (more steps = better quality, longer wait)
   - **Guidance**: How closely to follow your prompt
5. Tap Generate
6. Wait 1-5 minutes (video generation takes longer than images)
7. Watch your video!

**On Web:**
1. Open the Generate section
2. Switch to "Video" mode
3. Describe your video (e.g., "a cat playing with a ball of yarn")
4. Set video parameters:
   - **Dimensions**: Width and height (e.g., 1280x720)
   - **Duration**: How long (5-10 seconds)
   - **Steps**: Quality level (more steps = better quality, longer wait)
   - **Guidance**: How closely to follow your prompt
5. Click Generate
6. Wait 1-5 minutes (video generation takes longer than images)
7. Watch your video!

### Progress Tracking

While your video generates:
- See progress percentage
- Estimated time remaining
- You can minimize the app (mobile) or switch tabs (web) and return later

## Video Tips & Best Practices

### Writing Video Prompts

Videos work best with action descriptions:

**Good Video Prompts:**
- "A wave crashing on a beach at sunset, slow motion"
- "A person walking through a forest, camera following behind"
- "Flowers blooming in time-lapse, vibrant colors"

### Video Prompt Tips

- **Include movement**: Videos need action!
- **Specify camera movement**: "panning left," "zooming in," "static camera"
- **Describe timing**: "slow motion," "time-lapse," "normal speed"
- **Keep it simple**: One main action works best

### Choosing Dimensions

- **1280x720 (HD)**: Standard quality, faster generation
- **1920x1080 (Full HD)**: Higher quality, longer wait
- **Square (1080x1080)**: Perfect for Instagram, TikTok

### Understanding Generation Time

Video generation takes time because:
- Each frame must be generated
- Frames are combined into smooth video
- Higher quality = more processing time

**Typical Wait Times:**
- 5-second video, HD: 2-3 minutes
- 10-second video, Full HD: 4-5 minutes
- Higher quality settings: Up to 10 minutes

### Video Limits

- **Free Plan**: No video generation
- **Plus Plan**: 10 videos per day
- **Max Plan**: Unlimited videos

## Troubleshooting Video Generation

### Common Issues

**Video Takes Too Long:**
- This is normal! Videos take 1-5 minutes typically
- Higher quality settings take longer
- Check your internet connection

**Video Generation Fails:**
- Check your daily limit
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Try simplifying your prompt
- Try again in a few minutes

**Video Quality Issues:**
- Increase the "Steps" setting for better quality
- Use higher resolution dimensions
- Be more specific in your prompt

<Tip>
For best results, start with simpler prompts and shorter durations. Once you're comfortable, experiment with more complex scenes and longer videos.
